Playing with ML Models

This is a ML tesst using one of Apple's models and AVFoundation.  It works great, though the model is somewhat limited.

NOTE:  THIS WILL EAT YOUR BATTERY!  Seriously, it's only for messing around, it keeps the camera active the entire time it's running.

To use, clone and run in Xcode.
